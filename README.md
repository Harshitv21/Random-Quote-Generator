# Random Quote Generator

Random Quote Generator fetches a random quote from [quotable.io](https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction) along with a random background image from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo) whenever a new quote is fetched.
Added a delay to avoid spams 🏃‍♂️
